  ['A Chessington: World of AdventuresTM recount, or,  this short Westworld TM Fanfiction.<br><br><br>The lean-to structures: the Sheriff\’s Office 🤠 (a security watchtower🗼📡); the Blacksmith’s Forge 🔨 (a new giftshop); the unconvincing Jailhouse (perfect for novelty photo 📸 opportunities); the Saloon Bar 🍻 (for \“Sncks 🍔🌭 nd Rfrshmnts 🧃\” [courtesy of those who stole the vowels]); the Haunted Mineshaft 👻 ⛏ entrance (propped up behind a wooden queuing system) and the Shooting Range 🔫  (where I stand). Most of these elements still hide tumbledown versions 🏚 of their previous selves 🏠 – those which I became familiar with as I arrived here. The whispered plans for expansion had clearly gone to shit 💩 /, or up the creek 🛶. [...] Inside strained dreams: I’m sure they are skimping on the power ⚡️ I’m fed 🤤 and paid 💸💸💸 with – or maybe I’m just past my best, with repairs 🔧 becoming noticeably frequent these past few months 📅 (I won’t admit this fact though). \/\//The static whir of an empty electrical speaker 🔈 system before the needle lifts the twangy guitar 🪕 and galloping melody 🐎🎼 to life. The absence of sub-sonics 🔊 in the repetitive theme pipe an echoing whine 🎻 that meanders through the breeze 💨, as I return to my body with the power’s ⚡️ reengagement.\/\/\/ Today felt cooler ❄️, I reckoned. Cooler ❄️. I believe it felt cooler ❄️ as the tune made its third pass (already).<br>\*Motor oil ⛽️ (used as) joint lubricant: snaking 🐍 from wooden ass-crack to wooden upper inner thigh – granting potential for an imaginable shiver 🥶.\*<br><br>And I have no idea how big the park is 📏, nor how extensive its amusements are 🤡🤹‍♀️🎠🎢🎡. Bastardized for generations, I know it houses several generically themed areas. My first experience of these was a ‘Hall of Presidents’ 🇺🇸 - Dutch Angle glimpsed when two beefcake workmen 👷‍♂️👷‍♂️ dropped my box. Pretend searing pain in my lower back, then, while being welded onto an almost-exoskeleton ☠️, followed by a clumsy installation of ancient wires, fettering me into the park’s sickly pulse 🤒 like a primordial life support device, with no degree of change to the power ⚡️output feeding into me for the first few months 📅 whatsoever. You imagine the generators vibrating overnight, overfeeding 🤢 and burning great red holes ⭕️⭕️⭕️ around internal joints 💪🦵, while I stand haemorrhaging motor oil ⛽️.<br>\*Again here, Motor oil ⛽️ lingers on wooden inner thigh before proceeding further downwards ⬇️\*<br><br>The main square shares multiple attributes with the far off invention of Potemkin Villages 🇷🇺 – demonstrated one morning when two men in suits 👔 and hard-hats ⛑🦺 drinking coffee ☕️ from disposable cups stopped briskly outside my range and revealed that this square was erected atop the remnants of a far older ‘Prehistoric Island’ 🌋 - a realm that I assumed had belonged to the corporation that was here even before my employers (?). You see the faces of customers in lax disappointment. And shaking heads 🤦‍♀️, crossed arms 🙅‍♂️. Hunched shoulders. Crawling machines trampling the rockeries 🏗, dislodging this part of prehistoric 🦖🦕 (almost) reality from its physical space, and its slow and ancient time 🕰. The claws then digging deep and hauling the whole zone North 🧭, like an army of automated tugboats 🚢🚢🚢, leaving behind a blunt, stumpy architecture in a pie-bowl 🥧 crater of dry dirt… The whole act still complying with the customer’s desire for convenient authenticity (of course), an authenticity that is palatable (able to be consumed - swallowed). This land pines to be consumed. It was crafted -<br><br><br><br><br>all for the gut<br><br><br><br><br>- designed with the gut in mind, and custom built to bypass (the mental gag reflex 🤮 between) human pain and pleasure. I meditate on my visitors’ ideas of authenticity, with their secret knowledge that histories can simply be erased and moved in an expensive 💰 and almost mechanical flash 📸, pertaining to a fickle reversal: an excess of authenticity granted by its own hyperreal falsity. \/\/\/Thought interrupted by intermittent and jagged audio of some members of the board having heard that the park’s erection on ancient burial grounds could ‘make or break us,’ and at this remark the other Suit stiffens, with both men promising to keep that idea very hush hush.\/\/\/ Still, I struggle to imagine what sort of a person would visit a place themed around the death of Indigenous Peoples. In any event the Wild-West 🤠🐎 sat here now, slowly melting in the wrath 🔥.<br>\*The stream of motor oil ⛽️ splits in two before the bulge of wooden patella, opting to follow the contours of the back and side of wooden calf\*<br><br>The isle of dirt standing between my range and the giftshop is almost black, having been overexposed to the yellow that also bleaches me for around a third of each day. A small stone wall and a mottled metal bar protect it from the rest of reality. It is totally infecund, bar two PVC cacti cacti 🌵🌵 and a horse 🐎 melded with a saddle that is \“NOT TO BE CLIMBED!\”. The parched waterworks 💦 💦💦 that once cascaded ⛲️ from the pistols 🔫 🔫 of a dulled but grinning Cowboy 🤠 have been switched off, rife with an emerald patina. Expensive maintenance 💰, I supposed - once again acknowledging how the cowboy’s freckled cheeks ☺️ have slowly been windburned 💨🔥 to a leaden gurn 🤪. Perhaps the identity crisis of the park the Suits 👔 sometimes mentioned had an invisible hand 🤚 in the clear lack of repairs to exterior features.<br><br>\*Motor oil ⛽️ on wooden shin – the stream now slowing\*<br>I imagine this gloved and invisible hand 🤚 as I imagine greeting my co-stars each morning 🌄, who’s names I conjured up based on their looks alone. There’s Mike - a handsome and muscular Cowboy 💪🤠, stirrups coolly resting on a wooden table decorated with poker chips 🎲🎰 and empty metallic tankards 🍻 (each prop in the scene held in place by a clumsily glued seam: an excessive prevention of potential theft, here). And Mike has lovely eyes 👀, and soft, buttery looking hands 🙌. And I assume his waxen face is ruggedly handsome beneath the red bandanna covering his mouth 👄 (or, as handsome as something resembling a disfigured can encased in a fleshy layer of industrial paint 🎨 can be). Here, the thickset paint 🎨 seems to exaggerate his virility somehow, buffering the vague scraping of his painted features 🎨👃👄; all adding up to this image of a metal object brutally molded by stone or cinderblocks or bricks 🧱. By hands 🤚 and harsh force – a macho man in his essence 💪👨. If a visitor inserts change into the slot in order to ‘activate’ the range, and choses to shoot 🔫 their laser at Mike’s sensor, he falls backwards slightly on his chair 🪑, balancing in limbo – an action quite impossible beyond the mechanically enhanced physics of the range. His leg🦵raises from the table, his arm casting his tankard 🍺 skyward, while a dusty khaki StetsonTM jolts upwards ⬆️, revealing wily and matted brown hair peeling from an oily scalp; and then back down ⬇️.<br><br>There was Paul -  a man of few words - by far the oldest thing in the range. He really looked it too (cracks really starting to show in the varnish especially). A sour face 🍋 puckered impossibly inwards, as if he had been sculpted with expanding foam instead of paint 🎨 and rubber - dribbling in the dry haze, sheened in a lurid glisten. His mechanical animation is far simpler than Mike’s, permitted by his ripe age and assuredly ancient mechanisms 🔩⚙️. If a visitor inserts a coin into the slot in order to ‘activate’ the range, and choses to shoot 🔫 their laser at Paul’s sensor, he simply leans backwards into the shelves behind him, crusty lids grazing eyes 👀 - blue and empty, while his mouth 👅 clunks open revealing an abyss - bottomless and dry. No real feat of physics is defied here, as is the case if a visitor chooses to shoot 🔫 their laser at my sensor. My arms 💪💪 flail upwards, raising my faux Smith and WessonTM  🔫 (stripped to its skeleton ☠️ by teens while I dreamt, some years ago now) at my audience. My head spins painfully, while my body leans backwards (just beyond comfort), still anchored ⚓️ by my harsh frame.<br>You can see us here now: we are each a palimpsest, erased ✏️ and regenerated when the sun ☀️ bleaches us too harshly or when we are outmoded by a newer, more convincing version of ourselves. I feel nothing but sympathy towards the haggard, moth-eaten lump curled on the floor named Toby, who from this angle doesn’t look very much like a dog 🐶. Toby gets shot 🔫 at the most, letting out tired whimpers from a knackered speaker 🔉 somewhere inside his lumpen body. Visitors often call me ‘the bad’: a redux of a silver-screen outlaw, a re-release from the background of some long lost Western B-side. I’ve caught scattered glimpses of myself in the reflections of visitor’s sunglasses 🕶; brown chaps, red tasseled shirt (possibly) with silver brogueing, a barren bandolier completing the look. I have gathered the parts of my identity, composed myself years apart: a black moustache (rendered in plastic), grey handsy smears on a contorted toony face plastered with grin 😁 (from which several oversized teeth 🦷🦷🦷 are painted missing). I feel I am seen as a man 👨, or perhaps a phenomenally ugly woman 👩 based on the sheer amount I get shot at 🔫. The only other figure in my line of sight is the back half of a female figure’s outline - across the tiny desert island 🏝 in the Forge’s bay window. A head of glistening hair, followed by a long burgundy dress 👗 hanging from cream shoulders. Mary is a fantasy forbidden to me by my stationary condition. Besides, I could not abandon my post even if my limbs permitted me, for fear of disappointing my audience and failing my employers in some way.<br><br>Our sedentrary management of the Range fortunately requires no real housekeeping - other than to keep ourselves working by keeping our minds ticking over 🧠⏰ with listless recounts such as this. Each of our idiosyncrasies adds to the authenticity of our display - to my range - which is something I take great pride in. Our brilliant trifecta (because who really cares about Toby?), manages to balance the seriousness of our narrative (whatever it is) with the fun associated with shooting firearms 🔫 from a young age.<br>\*stream of motor oil ⛽️ passes rim of boot 🥾, slowly filling around the swollen wooden foot shape 🦶 inside\*<br><br><br>\*\*\*<br><br><br>Sunlight ☀️ glances off the various facades 👺🏘 of the square’s buildings. And I wonder if my legs 🦵🦵 will suddenly ache from all the standing I’ve done in this unchanging saloon. I gaze from the left hand side (visitor’s right) of the range, and out past the weathered poles maintaining the sagging porch, all the way across hazy cobblestone walkways and towards the Blacksmith’s Forge 🔨 . Exploring any pixel of my view in detail, rambunctious joints arch wrongly here and there - wilfully structural but bulging in the sweaty fug, as if they are freshly pruned branches leaking thick sap in the swelter. My immediate view appears to be held together by generous caulking along all visible seams, finished with an approximate pass of spray-paint – a hint that the less exposed parts of the scene were designed to be submerged in the ocean 🌊  someday, and for the park to still be able to function.<br><br><br>/\/\/Interruption of seeing: a blizzard-white shimmer on black waves.\/\/\/<br><br><br>- Not a bad view of things, I often admitted: just enough to keep my mind ticking over, with thoughts running themselves ragged with speculations on whether I had a higher purpose to serve than standing here, occasionally getting shot 🔫 at and sometimes reacting.<br><br><br><br><br>Visitors could enter my range and stand comfortably shaded by the long mandapam. On scorchers the air-conditioners inside would be turned up to full blast, and if enough people stood beneath the porch I pretended I could feel my body cooling ❄️, starting with the puckered fingers on my left hand 🖐 - the part of me that was nearest my audience. My agonising reaction often proves enough of a reward for the children, who these days seem far less inclined towards the arcade tickets 🕹🎟 that come spilling out of a hole in the top of the counter as reward for their accuracy in the allotted thirty second shooting window ⏱🔫. I feel a rising sense of joy ⬆️😊 as I watch them take aim with their oversized rifles, and then again as they giggle 😂 with satisfaction as the laser hits one of my sensors, forcing a painful (but clearly hilarious) reaction.<br><br>When they laugh 🤣 at me, I feel no shame as I used to: I would often retreat inside myself, quivering on the wooden floor of my head 🧠 – a feeling now replaced and buffered by years of consideration, with a sense of pride in facilitating their strange enjoyment. I see momentary hatred 😡 on scrunched faces - while they indulge in the (almost) violence, which is followed by unfathomable joy 🤩 at the mechanical rewarding of their immorality. Some don’t pay, simply simulating the public execution with an empty magazine instead. This hysterical play-act cycles in endless repetition, with the strange but pleasurable agony I feel when I’m shot, in my opinion, being the most realistic projection available in this town, if not the whole park. I know this because I feel the cold wrench ❄️🔧 – a strange comfort knowing that I have something tangible to cling to with all digits 🙏.<br>\*Motor oil ⛽️ spilling over the rim of a rough, Naugahyde[TM] boot 🥾, pooling harsh and dark on wooden floorboards\*<br>\[Notice the motor oil ⛽️ here: see it as a writhing semiotic liquid, imbued with strange power.\]<br>The underpaid 💵📉 actors, the cuddly lovers 🥰👫, the overfed kids who laze through here each share a meniscus of hyperactive falsity that bobs above the pool of their character, glazing their eyes 👀 as if they’ve undergone some wild hypnosis 🧙‍♂️😴. I guess it’s how the town 🏫 plays with their heads 🧠. My goal in all of this is therefore to<br>blend in completely,<br>to become<br>an unthinking component<br>of my olden surroundings. In terms of my sensorial experience (if I can call it that) I ponder my innate confusion between corporeal pleasure and pain. I ponder my experiential importance compared to the unprecedented importance of my audience’s experience. I have been designed as subservient: I wonder whether to feign my reactions, and if they can even see 👀 my exertions making a difference physically. All I know for a fact is that I do not want to come across as a phoney. In any event, the vague approbation of my audience seems to keep me moving forwards 🛣, so to speak, and keeps me from the clutches of mindlessness 🧠😵 that I so often feel looming behind me, unable to turn my head and gaze its gloved and invisible hand 🤚 silently advancing - an ailment that seems to have befallen my counterparts, rendering them silent 🤫 and unknowing.<br><br>\*\*\*<br><br><br>\/\/\/Noticing: All mornings drag.\/\/\/<br>Today was especially sweltering 🥵. No visitors yet. If I could sweat 😓 I’m sure I would be (etc.). A few meandering past: fathers and daughters 👨‍👧 together for the day – all fathers clearly eager to leave the park soon in order to beat the pre-empted but totally fictitious<br><br><br><br>‘mob’ of others.<br><br>Kids running off in every direction - sugar-infused energy 🍬🍭 thwarted by firm grasps 👊 on wrists. My thoughts drift through the unconvincing middle American daydream 🇺🇸😴: ‘Mobs’ hadn’t entered this place for years, although one occurrence always surfaced in my memory: the first time I had ever been shot 🔫 to figurative smithereens by a kid using a laser pointer he must’ve smuggled past security. A memory manacled away in a dark corner of my wooden head 🧠, which on that day must’ve spun into triple figures, my arms 💪💪 flailing animatedly, snagging in their ancient sockets. The relentless hammering energy 🔨⚡️ I received from the generators I imagine to be hidden behind the set somewhere, forming a dark heat 🔥 in my wooden thighs, rising to linger in my wooden groin, with all the energy from my wooden being drawn there. My wooden arms 💪💪 hanging numbly, wooden elbows feeling nothing while wooden legs  🦵🦵 shook violently, the stand creaking and spitting out swift plumes of dust. A real lump in my hollowed-out chest, then. My body pulsating its way into blunt contortions. The energy ⚡️ in my wires throbbing to the beat 🥁 of my rocking, while saccharin sweet laughter 🍬🤣 burst from the lips of my tormentors; regrouping, reforming and resounding again and again - a ricochet between wooden ears 👂👂. To become relieved through the basest of feelings, animalised in full discomfort of my visitors, all taking photos 🤳📸 (photography sadly being actively permitted in the park) of my combustion 💥. Wooden eye 👁sockets aching - a mental pipeline 🧠 had ruptured throughout me.<br><br>The maintenance men 🛠 even had to come and stop the ticket machine from spewing so violently, making a rare and hazy daylight ☀️ appearance (although they just looked like the regular park safety officers 🦺, still all specky but now wearing Indiginous headdresses with their sweaty beige shirts, and carrying tomahawks alongside their toolkits 🧰). The image of customers watching the borderline voyeuristic spectacle - the leakage of oil ⛽️ from the back of my drainpipe chaps (just as it leaks from my body now - the damage undergone seemingly irreparable). All was enough to make me want to fade out, to exit the stage-set. The audience waned slowly throughout that fateful afternoon I remember, while the repairmen 🛠 welded me back onto my stand once more.<br>\*Streaming motor oil ⛽️ seems to falter, the puddle filling it’s usual and deeply soaked parameter on the wooden floor;<br>the parameter of a mindless number of identical daily motor oil ⛽️ leakages.\*<br>\/\/\/At noon the heat deadens.\/\/\/<br>I think of eager birds 🦅 circling above. I can’t look 👀 to see if there are any. The sky in the jailhouse windows reflects a luminous FantaTM orange, the cracked plastic framing the windows having leaked in years of sunlight ☀️ causing an unworldly tint (but I know the sky has to be a pale aegean blue [and completely cloudless] for the air conditioners ❄️ to be whirring so loudly).<br>While my thoughts flatline under our ancient wooden framing,<br>I imagine my job’s specification (which I imagine to be filed neatly in an imaginary and more abandoned part of the park) saying to<br>remain completely apathetic to the public’s reactions,<br>and to<br><br>the wrenching levels of pain experienced when shot 🔫 at.<br>It says to<br><br>remain living in fear of this pain,<br>and<br><br>the constant dull sting of the sun ☀️ cooking the painted skin off my head, burning my varnished scalp.<br><br><br><br>I feel my purpose is undermined by even the smallest distractions my visitors encounter: I am secondary to say, a fly 🦟 buzzing around them, or a more appealing, newer structure with more attractive and shiny versions of myself inside. The basest level of my consciousness – how I feel waking from those dreams - seems to have been engrained with the idea that I am here to serve the higher purpose of their enjoyment until I am outmoded, and that is all. \/\/\/Audio interruption of: the the maddening theme-tune revisiting in the air – striking off-chords and pitchy harmonics – it seems heavier now, like a winding funeral dirge.\/\/\/<br><br>I have higher hopes for the future, and feel as if my fate is not sealed in this sticky, mock-up saloon. Totally destitute, my main source of humiliation comes from the mechanics 🛠 when they strip me down to my waxen flesh in front of my audience in order to fix me, peeling me apart to re-oil ⛽️ or re-solder my innards 🔩⚙️. It doesn’t matter if the Suits 👔 who want to ‘keep things neat’ dislike my forced nudity 😣 in front of my audience or not, because they never seem to find out, and even if they did the excuses of the grunting mechanics 🛠 - after patting my wooden buttocks - would be enough to shut them up anyway. I am unable to thwart their movements in any way: my body stands rigid with catalepsy. I can merely watch 👀 what they do to me, figuratively biting a metaphorical lip 👄, silently willing that they don’t pry me apart too harshly, or scratch the inside of my rib-plate with their tools ☠️🛠. To them I am a punchbag-cum-man 🥊👨, preternaturally resistant through my inanimate being, and this grants me another morsel of joy – in knowing that their purpose lies in my maintenance.<br><br>\/\/\/The cool end of each day brings physical solace, at least\/\//<br>the horizon 🌅 dusking beneath the long, ragged veranda. When the enclosure is switched off and the pretend gas-lamps mute, I am free to wander within dreams 🏃‍♂️💭, or, rather exist through lucid hypnogogic hallucinations. (The stupor I enter each night may be partly due to the fact that the wires running into my lower back remain half on; the generators churning noisily somewhere.) I step away from my metal struts, leaping the gun counter 🔫. I am able to glide 🦅 - no - walk over to the barren island 🏝, looking the cheesy Cowboy 🤠 dead in the eye. I feel - no - touch the bins, inspect their flecked paintwork, experience their rust. I watch the faux lamps more clearly, the warm orange glow, \/\//their low hum\/\// strangely comforting. I feel the cobbles - still warm from the sun ☀️ - through my boots 🥾🥾. I drift towards Mary’s window, passing straight through the discoloured panes without shattering them, until I stand next to her, regarding her slender profile, my hand almost brushing her pale shoulder, hovering there, moments away, as if any movement could shatter the perfect illusion, the moment trapped in my mind’s eye 🧠👁, engrained onto waxen eyelids I cannot close.<br>This, followed by a breakneck realisation: as I approach her front, my sheer anxiety is replaced by horror at the realisation that the limp mannequin is all but featureless: blindly painted 🎨 gestures on fabric (just hinting at an identity - a look), while all parts are peeling, reduced to a skeletal ☠️ carapace. Staggering backwards reveals the flies’ feast in full -  the whole body an immobile nest of woodworms, of termites, of flying things gorging themselves 🦟🦟🦟. In an instant the reality of bare flesh is at once understood and infinitely mystified by the mannequin’s false materiality, by it’s false humanity.<br><br>The creatures flutter through the darkness, becoming mobile through my shock: bumping into the glass, travelling towards the gas lamps outside (while I regard their meal, their process). The mundanity of a daily oil leakage ⛽️ seems just fine now, my disappointment in my own defects made infinitesimally small and distant. The horror of realisation setting my chest into tightening spasms; my legs 🦵🦵 no longer working (or wanting to work). I pulse as I stare 👀, furled energy behind glassy eyes 👁👁: aghast the rotting thing, at all the misconceptions. I am elevated, and cannot escape the hold of my physical body, being dragged backwards past the rusty bins, the gas-lamps, the cheesy Cowboy’s rigid smile 🤠 and the long porch of the Range, grasping; wooden nails scraping along the cobbles before I’m back upright, rigid, re-soldered onto my stand in the dark. My mind races for countless moments, wishing for the prelapsarian bliss of mundanity, the endless motor oil leakage ⛽️ and the looping theme tune 🪕🔊 from before my nightmare, \/\/\/as I come back to my body with the power’s reengagement.\/\/\/'],

A heady fug hanging delicately above the water, woolen clouds in gentle suspension.<br>Diving there was fun, despite the quagmire’s bitter stagnation gradually ebbing away at those vast banks, at the slanted rockfaces above us all - (all while face first, with bony digits); upstanding like some long forgotten skeletal stronghold or - playset, rather - Its rocky trails and misty ramparts jutting all haphazardly. Towards the rim of the scene are passages wide enough for those vehicles to meander down like oozing things, born in the same water in which he now ‘fucked about’ in - with those stalegtital pronounciations above shattering any potential for forward - or - onward thought, blunt geometries running into the mire adding a brutish nature to the place. - Followed by Eyes withdrawing from the fingered points above to the the spinal arc of the land, curling towards the outer edge of the horizon and flattening off into a dotted line, which would no doubt trail off at some point, ellipsing into some vast ocean.<br><br>The place was half-baked: a glitchy, uhm maimed, almost - prisoner; beneath bruised landforms etched into clouds snow-white that they had to be some sort of simulation, figured out by precise values set on digital sliders somewhere, and, all lined up on some redundant comping program at that. The mountains entail us as some giant curtain printed with rolling hills and vast skies. A blunt wind dusting peninsulas, skattering aggregate amongst the scarce plantlife jutting up from a particle system that joins each part of the beach.

The radio mentions something about everybody heading back home to Burbank in time for the holidays, ellipsing into strange talk of the ‘analog’ nature of ‘mountains’.<br>Blindingly arid; - The ground houses blackened cacti, interrupted by an occasional bleached out model-town, stood among the scattering of glass bottles and pebbles. A midwestern model set - props on another scale, a Starred and Striped scale, for example. For example, Pylons stretch for miles and weave in and out of the interstate for example, which is the only thing that vibrates with some trace of man, cutting a God-scale swathe through the dirt. In the more built-up regions, vertiginous outcrops jut impossibly, caking the road in shadow, causing strobing when Walt compresses the gas a little harder. The purr of the engine panting and ticking over, hidden below a throbbing acrylic nacelle, cast in the hottest-pink possible; extra bright against the faded gunmetal of the bonnet’s phoenix motif. Dark blotches cuddle into the spiralling trails on the mountains to the far west, tar coloured tunnels-cum-gullets, gaping ajar - swallowing light - and culling it into millions of splintered shards. Take this mouth, appear from another on the next cliff-face moments later. Hours tick as flatlands pan, completely stationary to the perpendicular movement of the jeepster. Gliding for miles and then sitting for days, here, where its the style to pull off the dusty interstate and meet old friends in blackout motels - shops shuttered for the forever-off season - Walt’s hands gripping the wheel until they’re as raw as the blistered naugahyde itself.  Pulling off the road, he buys up every magic tree airfreshener available as we refuel, paying by cashiers’ cheque and then attaching them around the central-rear-view-mirror one-by-one, until the brittle plastic aches wrongly under the elastic strain; a real attempt to cover the stench of shit that now wafted around him, pervading his character as if it had been sewn into the lining of every one of his pastel suit jackets.Mirages completing themselves in the stillness: the limitless silence, recounting echoes of \“Studio Executive entrance\” signs rising above the horizon. But all the vowels are painted out, replaced by blatant white brushstrokes.<br><br>…<br>Someday, the interstate parts: A dirt-track that houses the spectral echoes of (said) studio entrance (signs). Approaching, sunlight glances off the various facades of the square’s buildings, rambunctious joints arching in the swealter - wilfully structural but bulging like freshly pruned branches leaking a thick sap. My immediate view appears to be held together by generous caulking along all visible seams, finished by an approximate pass of spray-paint-over-the-cracks:A workplace architecturally charged with stifled ‘toonish potentiality. The static whir of an empty electrical speaker usually reserved for workplace announcements -<br>imbuing the discomfort of the environment with a sort of anti-ambience, a strengthening of hyperreality. The absence of subsonics in the unending note pipes an echoing whine that meanders through the breeze. The lean-to structures, The corrugated steel, the sheer miles of galvanised chainlink fences, the vast sheets of plastic wrap; vs. the sparce, weathered poles maintaining sagging mandapams at each entryway - against the graffitti under animators’ desks in locked rooms. These new elements all obscuring tumbledown versions of their previous selves. - the soon to be ultimate compound-cum-animation-studio reccounting the intentions of a potemkin villiage. A compound of myriad faux-structures intergral to it’s ethos.

To build it: crawling machines trampling archaic rockeries, dislodging parts of aehistoric land from its own space, from the desert’s slow and ancient time. The bucketed claws then digging deep into the earth leaving behind a blunt, stumpy architecture in a pie-bowl of dry dirt.<br><br>Walt moves his hand from the tip of the Walnut gearstick: A reassuring squeeze of my err lower middle thigh, and then back to driving, as the Pontiac purrs down into third, then second, then to silence as the gates open, swallowing the car into a blizzard of signs and masks.<br><br>\“Bastard!\” is yelling one Animator.<br>\“Employer!\” yells another.<br><br>My thoughts drift through the middle American daydream: My time here, first written - drawn - actualised - across a beautiful and fabled summer, sat aloft in a cradle of crawling grass, littered with pearlwort and more lucky clovers than are countable. Back amongst the grass, this time blue with an evening shimmer, shawn between a crackling beechwood fire and a tent pitched kurtly upon a grassy mound. Days in June commemorated, butthen massacred by this thick and fast frost that got into my bones a little bit, and was really, really mean - the kind that comes alongside the bedtime gloam, whilst sitting with swollen bellies in front of vast logfires powering early steamboats. A shin-height mist and an ache in the face. The burble of nearby water on rocks, rocks lining a gentle bank, obscure arcana strewn about the deck - maps, scrolls, brooms, ancient objects, ways of imparting wisdom - knowledge.<br>…<br>Drawn on rockfaces,then on paper.<br><br>I come to to medieval Tomatoes pelting the Pontiac’s bonet, and a caustic air, just livid with quiet, the engine filling the hole instead. The muscle-car rolling along now, glazed visions from stationary protestors clutching rough-cut signage, each home-made prop held together by clumsy glue. The waxen flesh of their masks making the crowd a single, cultish form, here: signs as pitchforks, faces as seven dwarves, as princesses - faces haunting in their stillness, in their otherworldly alterity. Human-proportioned animal-effigies dangled on big, long sticks sporing soot. Rueful gusts - no doubt the formidable stench of trace evidence, memories, fragments of past uses, here. Also, the release of something spiritual - work hours disregarded through the burning of prelimenary sketchees, concept art, and original plates from the archival shed at the back of the square, also -  scoulded ideas, drifting cruely around the statue in the middle of it all:<br><br>Walt and Mickey hold hands and wave at the horizon, standing in a fountain of crystal water, now little more than an isle of dirt in a stagnant pond from all the ash and human shit. The bronze statue, rife with an emerald patina, stands aloft from the crowd - protestors climbing a bronzed Walt, who’s face has been slowly windburned into a leaden gurn, who’s waving at the angry masses, exquisitely garnished with 3 small black circle mouse head emblem branded logo pin, to the perfect scale, of course. - The fountain also decorated by the broomstick workforce of Fantasia, their enslavement originally animated as an accident, a wizard’s hat charming several broomsticks into BLIND and rhythmic labour: with this now becoming apparent as a thinly veiled reference to Walt’s ability to bend subjectivities to his will, to quell anger, to obfuscate blame, to disguise bitter pills as a copium for the masses. The magical object’s potentiality mirroring Walt’s employer power: \“For the good of the studio\” he often uttered in his sleep. A small stone wall and a mottled metal bar keep the fountain from the rest of reality. It is \“NOT TO BE CLIMBED!\”, The parched waterworks that once cascaded from the dulled tips of the brooms have been switched off.<br><br>The desert now as Icarean hellscape, with high flight having its consequences. A melting; crashing, followed by a purgatorial marooning on the Burbank solitude, all while stuck-fast with feathers - gazing back through the galvanised chainlink fence into the studio carpark. The fault was his own. A Hoodoo seance - undertaken late at night in the blacked out studios some months ago now, by Walt’s CRACK TEAM - Alchemical sacrifice, blood sacrifice - the rendering of the fleshen body - a transmutation of figurative bodily fluids, as in, blood sweat and tears - or, labour related liquids.<br><br>Walt’s anger at his workforce, released publically<br>- the final cut of Dumbo -<br>released right under their noses.<br><br>The film’s gaggle of clowns standing as weaponized charicatures of the studio’s disperately paid workforce, in a bid to cull \"the chip-on-the-shoulder boys and the world-owes-me-a-living lads\” - with this creative recontextualization and consequent employee degredation resulting in a fickle reversal: an excess of authenticity granted by its own hyperreal falsity. A powerful spell - a retort rendered through the basest of communications: flattened, drawn planes… encoding spite into each still’s very essence. - The clowns appearing incapable of rendering a reality unfettered by work time, remaining in costume without perfroming, acting out Walt’s spectral shadowshow behind a piece of cloth, in thick New York accents -<br><br>\“Just wait til we hit the big top\” Cry all.<br>\“This gives me an idea: let’s raise the platform the elephant jumps off of.\”<br>\“Yeah!

Class subordination rendered into two-dimensional reality. Cartoon faces as political machinegun. A nightmarish mimesis: A protest march, of harmful yet innocent images - the fun of cartoons turned against the owner, a kinky role reversal of fetish value, of master and drone - the animators still subservient in a profound and powerful way, and as revenge for their devalued status, elevating Walt’s to that of a true villain, killed somewhere offscreen in the film’s final moments.<br><br>Analogue video camera whirring like a dynamo - handheld chaoticism capturing all.<br>security’s lumpen riot gear stands no chance:<br>tussle in the entropic silence.<br>People can rally behind things like cartoons: An adoring audience sat at home, along for the ride. Atomised rooting for favorite characters creating a strange power, with people even then realising that their psychies were being imprisoned.<br><br>Protest pyres burning priceless archives of animation cells. The fetid miasma of burnt fiction. Grins widen as flames climb, lapping at the sky. A sooty penumbra casting LONGER SHADOWS - the ritual now forming an occult smoke-signal. Flaming effigies fill the car’s skylight - Walt’s characters’ - ‘MADE FLESH’ here in terms of their figurative demise. Image based assult. Cute violence, deployed as militant tactic. The animator-cum-guerilla movement was mutating, reforming out of atomized digits into a conglomoate structure rivaling the vertiginous empire they stood facing.<br><br>Proletariat vs multinational.<br>Comerarderie collapsing and expanding, again and again.<br>Drown the car.<br>Independent goods retailer vs big pharma, doping off its own supply.<br>Small-flick vs. big blockbuster.<br><br>The final straw then - a brutal fictionalization.

How deep must we delve to undo this?<br>A true longing for the prelapsarian bliss of the pre-mundanity, of anywhere before now, and for that fabled summer,<br>Ending the days like most MGM endings, by driving (not quite into, but almost at) the sunset, now painted as a mural on the wall at the back of the studio’s lot.'],

  ['Quicksand<br><br>Any form of posthumous distortion (reverb, timestretching, echo delay) visually conjures the alignment of the production studio into a single instrument, as originally in dub, etc. The coming unlive of musical equipment occurs as easily as a spell is cast, weaponizing impossibly complex machinery into a single circuit diagram on a desk in a bedroom somewhere. Working backwards, the equation of bedroom to studio can be recast, their relationship extrapolated, revealing a solitary (living) environment navigating its own (a)temporality, dislocated from whatever lies beyond the closed door’s frame by a barricade of coats, bags, the rest. The room’s window projects a panorama of grey living blocs outside, visibly saturated by material goods and luxuriously textured objects in their own windows: fruit bowls, juicers, walk-in showers, fridge-freezers, flatscreens, faux plants, mottled carpets and Scandinavian furniture dragged in from the street.

Spectral echoes lurk (specrtate?) in forthcoming bars and phrases, becoming (re)acted out in reverberant shadowshows, punctuated by syncopated pierces, bubbling threats of breaks, and the entire archival arsenal of the electronic drum. The tomography of the ground elevates and declines rhythmically, the floorboards impossibly elasticated by vibration. A gentle undulation maps the convergence of the gaps between these boards - now acting as dark ley-lines, meeting each time the volume speaks. Blizzard-white lattices unfolding within the synaptic recesses of the mind — as lights flare behind the eyelids — as the smell of scored carbon proliferates. Awash, afloat, waves flatten, churn, and repeat. Lulls of calm straits are dotted with sea birds as country birds as city birds, perching outside the bedroom window now. Sunlight bleeds, revealing dust particles as microscopic interventions in space - spherical (almost) isometries, crystaline structures blindingly reflective - as they make their way down from the blind’s slats to filter between the wooden floorboards. The room’s contents become droned by the same hexen curse: the racks of analogue equipment are left to grow old on a wooden desk. (Hay)wires serve their purposes, flaring the black boxes’ lights in time with the music. Here, count, to, four — and again.'],

Sheets of corrugated steel, miles of chain-link fencing, and vast lengths of plastic wrap contrast the square’s ancient cornerstones from a nearby quarry, the sagging mandapams outside each set-piece, and the graffiti scrawlings hidden under ancient animation desks in forever-locked rooms. The once great animation-studio now recounts the intentions of a Potemkin village more than ever. A mysterious zone populated by faux-structures, structurally integral to it’s new ethos. On site there are no longer film-sets, but life-sets: relaxation lounges for the executives, smoking rooms, private pools, tiled balconies, meteorite fragments on display and vast penthouse suites: the works. Now that the Wi-Fi is up and running, components for office block renovation leak in from cyberspace. Holographic I-beams grow along the Z-Axis, from between the cracks of the dry lakebed. The consumer idyll which occupies the highway some miles back quickly undergoes a drastic neotokyoization, as the studio becomes surrounded by scaffolding on all sides. Postmodern renditions of living blocs overshadow the sun, while vast layers of virtualized strata support crystalline Helicopter pads in the Heavens.
